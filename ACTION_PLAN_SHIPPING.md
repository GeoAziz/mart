## 🚀 IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (Do This Now)

### Step 1: Verify Dependencies (5 min)
```bash
cd /mnt/devmandrive/projects/mart
python tests/preflight_check.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Python packages (selenium, pytest, requests)
✅ Chrome WebDriver
✅ Server running (http://localhost:3000)
✅ Master E2E test file exists
✅ Backend validator module
✅ Test credentials configured
✅ Reports directory writable
✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED (8/8)
```

### Step 2: Start Dev Server (In Separate Terminal)
```bash
cd /mnt/devmandrive/projects/mart
npm run dev
```

**Wait for:**
```
▲ Next.js 15.x.x
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

### Step 3: Run E2E Test (70-80 minutes)
```bash
cd /mnt/devmandrive/projects/mart
bash run_e2e_test.sh
```

OR direct:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_complete_user_journeys.py::TestCompleteUserJourneys::test_complete_journey_all_users -v -s
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ ✅ ✅ COMPLETE E2E TEST PASSED ✅ ✅ ✅
========================================
All 3 user journeys verified successfully!
  - Customer: Login → Browse → Add to Cart → Checkout Ready
  - Vendor: Login → Dashboard Accessible
  - Admin: Login → Dashboard Accessible
========================================

## 📊 RESULTS ANALYSIS (After Test Passes)

### Check Report
```bash
cat tests/reports/e2e_report_<latest>.json
```

**Should show:**
- All 4 phases completed
- Zero console errors
- All 3 user types successfully logged in
- ~70-80 minutes execution time

### View Screenshots
```bash
open tests/reports/screenshots/  # macOS
# OR
explorer tests/reports/screenshots/  # Windows
# OR
xdg-open tests/reports/screenshots/  # Linux
```

**Key screenshots to verify:**
- `landing_page_*.png` - Website loads, header visible
- `pdp_view_*.png` - Product page loads, buttons visible
- `product_added_to_cart_*.png` - Cart feedback shows
- `customer_journey_complete_*.png` - Checkout form filled
- `vendor_dashboard_*.png` - Vendor can access dashboard
- `admin_dashboard_*.png` - Admin can access dashboard

### Verify Firestore State
Open Firebase Console → Firestore → Collections:
- `users/` - Should have customer, vendor, admin docs with correct roles
- `products/` - Products should exist
- `carts/` - Customer cart should have items
- `orders/` - Orders should exist (if payment flow tested)

## 💡 WHAT HAPPENS DURING TEST

### Real Actions Tested
1. **Server boots** - Checks health
2. **Landing page loads** - Navigates to `/`
3. **Responsive design** - Resizes viewport 3x, checks layout
4. **Customer login** - Email + password → redirects to `/account`
5. **Browse products** - Clicks through `/products`
6. **View product** - Lands on PDP with images, price, buttons
7. **Add to cart** - Button click → validation → **Firestore check**
8. **Add to wishlist** - Heart toggle → **Firestore check**
9. **View cart** - Sees items added
10. **Checkout form** - Fills address, email, phone
11. **Vendor login** - Different user → `/vendor` dashboard
12. **Admin login** - Different user → `/admin` dashboard

### Backend Validations Happen
After each action, system verifies:
- ✅ Data exists in Firestore
- ✅ User roles are correct
- ✅ Cart items persisted
- ✅ Wishlist items persisted
- ✅ Product stock valid
- ✅ No orphaned records

## 🚨 IF TEST FAILS

### Common Issues & Fixes

**"Server not running"**
```bash
# Fix: Start server
npm run dev
```

**"Element not found"**
- UI changed location → Update XPath in test
- Element takes time to load → Increase wait timeout (already 15s)
- Screenshot will show what's on screen → adjust locator

**"Timeouts waiting for URL"**
- Network slow → Can happen in CI/CD
- Increase timeout from 10s to 15s
- Usually not a real failure, just timing

**"Firestore validation failed"**
- Backend state didn't match UI
- **CRITICAL ISSUE** - means code is broken
- Check Firebase console for actual data
- Debug backend code

**"PayPal flow failed"**
- Expected - sandbox requires manual approval
- Test skips actual payment, just verifies flow reaches PayPal screen
- Not blocking for shipping

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with detailed output
export HEADLESS=false
export DEBUG=true
python -m pytest tests/test_complete_user_journeys.py -v -s --tb=long

# Keep browser open on failure
export KEEP_BROWSER_OPEN=true
```
