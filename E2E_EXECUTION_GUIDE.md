## 🎬 HOW TO RUN (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Start Your Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
# Wait for "ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000"
```

### Step 2: Run the E2E Test
```bash
cd /mnt/devmandrive/projects/mart

# Option A: Using the runner script (recommended)
bash tests/run_e2e.sh

# Option B: Direct pytest (if script doesn't work)
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 python -m pytest tests/test_complete_journey.py -v -s

# Option C: Run specific phase only
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 python -m pytest tests/test_complete_journey.py::TestCompleteUserJourney::test_phase_2_customer_journey -v -s
```

### Step 3: Check Results
- HTML Report: `tests/reports/logs/report.html`
- Screenshots: `tests/reports/screenshots/`
- Console output will show pass/fail per step

## ⚙️ ENVIRONMENT SETUP (One Time)

### Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r tests/requirements_e2e.txt
```

Or individually:
```bash
pip install selenium pytest requests python-dotenv
```

### Verify Chrome/Chromium
The test uses your system Chrome. Verify it's installed:
```bash
which chromedriver  # or
chrome --version
```

If missing, install:
```bash
# macOS
brew install chromedriver

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install chromium-browser

# Or use webdriver-manager (auto-downloads)
pip install webdriver-manager
```

### Update .env if needed
```bash
# From your workspace root
cat .env | grep -E "BASE_URL|PAYPAL|FIREBASE"
```

## 🔍 WHAT HAPPENS DURING TEST

### Real Browser Automation
- Opens real Chrome browser (not headless by default)
- Navigates through UI exactly like a human
- Clicks buttons, fills forms, waits for page loads
- Takes screenshots on failure

### Automatic Reporting
- Every step logged to console
- Each phase prints status
- Screenshots captured at key points
- HTML report generated with timeline

### Error Handling
- If any step fails, test stops at that point
- Error message clearly shows what broke
- Full stack trace available
- Screenshot taken for debugging

### Timing
- Total run time: ~40-50 minutes (all 4 phases)
- To run faster: Run phases separately (each ~5-15 min)
- No external dependencies needed (self-contained)

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Chrome Not Found
```bash
# Error: "Chrome not found"
# Solution: Install Chrome or use headless mode
HEADLESS=true bash tests/run_e2e.sh
```

### Connection Refused
```bash
# Error: "Connection refused" on localhost:3000
# Solution: Make sure dev server is running
npm run dev  # in separate terminal
```

### Timeout Errors
```bash
# Error: "Element not found" or "Timeout"
# Solution: Increase wait time or check selectors
# Edit test_complete_journey.py, increase timeout from 10 to 20
```

### Login Fails
```bash
# Error: "Login unsuccessful"
# Check credentials in CREDENTIALS.md
# Verify user exists in Firestore
# Make sure Firebase is initialized
```

### Can't Find Report
```bash
# Report not generated
# Check if tests/reports/logs directory exists
mkdir -p tests/reports/logs tests/reports/screenshots
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA (Ship Gate)

✅ All 4 phases pass  
✅ No console errors  
✅ Total time < 10 minutes  
✅ HTML report generated  
✅ Screenshots captured  
✅ No login failures  
✅ Cart operations work  
✅ Navigation links work  

---

## 📈 NEXT STEPS (After First Run)

### If All Pass (Perfect!)
1. Run test 2 more times to confirm no flakiness
2. Document any manual configuration needed
3. Commit to CI/CD for automated runs
4. Prepare for production deployment

### If Some Fail
1. Check error message and screenshot
2. Verify test credentials are correct
3. Check if UI selectors changed (adjust XPaths)
4. Verify backend is responding correctly
5. Run only that phase to debug:
   ```bash
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 python -m pytest tests/test_complete_journey.py::TestCompleteUserJourney::test_phase_2_customer_journey -v -s
   ```

### To Add More Tests
- Duplicate test method in class
- Add new phase (PHASE 5, PHASE 6, etc.)
- Keep same structure (bootstrap → steps → teardown)
- Add to pytest main() at bottom

## 💡 TIPS FOR PRODUCTION

### Run Periodically
```bash
# Add to crontab (every 6 hours)
0 */6 * * * cd /mnt/devmandrive/projects/mart && bash tests/run_e2e.sh > tests/reports/cron.log 2>&1
```

### CI/CD Integration
Create `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`:
```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run dev &
      - run: sleep 5
      - run: pip install -r tests/requirements_e2e.txt
      - run: BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 pytest tests/test_complete_journey.py -v
```

### Performance Monitoring
Add timing checks:
```python
# In test, after each phase
if phase_duration > 5 * 60:  # 5 minutes
    print(f"⚠️ Phase took {phase_duration}s (target: <5 min)")
```

---

## 🎬 READY TO EXECUTE

**All files are in place. Your next action:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run E2E test
bash tests/run_e2e.sh
```

**That's it. No more setup. No more waiting. Pure automation. 🚀**
