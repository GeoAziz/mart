# âœ… Congratulations! The app is configured!

All the necessary Firebase keys have been added. The application should now be running without the configuration error.

## Final Optional Step: Enable AI Features

The core e-commerce functionality is working, but the advanced AI features (Chatbot, Recommendations, etc.) are currently disabled.

To enable them, you just need one last key:

1.  Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Click **"Create API key"** and copy the key.
3.  Open the `.env` file in your project.
4.  Paste the key as the value for `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
5.  Restart the development server.

That's it! All features will now be active.
